What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file in the directory helping git system to keep track of the project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Maybe it is a temporary place that handles which files should be commited in the repo.
