What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a .git file in the directory helping git system to keep track of the project.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Maybe it is a temporary place that handles which files should be commited in the repo.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

Staging area can keep your edited files together until the logical change is completed and we are ready to commit.
