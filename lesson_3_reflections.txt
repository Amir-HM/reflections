When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating, or when using different systems online instead of using a fixed one.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to get informed of the changes, or maybe you are working on the exact same changes and it may overwrite the changes you yourself have made.
