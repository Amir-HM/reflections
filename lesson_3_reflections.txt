When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When collaborating, or when using different systems online instead of using a fixed one.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to get informed of the changes, or maybe you are working on the exact same changes and it may overwrite the changes you yourself have made.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Pretty obvious :|


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

We can compare and get informed of changes that others made.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

No need to learn the concepts is the easy part, and the rest would be harder (but free for private uses).
